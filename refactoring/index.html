                    <h2>Rule of Three</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When you do something for the first time, you are just doing it to get done.</li>
                        <li>When you do something similar for the second time, you cringe at having to repeat but do the same thing anyway.</li>
                        <li>When you do something for the third time, you start refactoring.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>When fixing a bug</h2>
                    <p>Bugs resemble cockroaches: they love to live in the darkest, mustiest places of your code. Clean up your code and the errors will practically find themselves.</p>

                    <h2>When adding a feature</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Refactoring helps to understand other people's code.</b> If it becomes necessary to add a feature to unclear code, refactoring it makes things obvious for you and those coming after you.</li>
                        <li><b>Refactoring makes it easier to add features. </b> New features are added more smoothly and with less effort.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>During code review</h2>
                    <p>Review may be your last chance to tidy up your code before it becomes available to the public.</p>
                    <p>The best way to review is together with the author of the code. You propose changes and decide, together with the author, how difficult it will be to implement various refactoring techniques. Small changes can be made right on the spot.</p>
